# Dilan's RTL_Airband Docker Container

This repo contains all of the files I use to create my own Docker container for RTL_Airband.

As far as the general public is concerned, I'm putting this out there for education and experimentation. This is not designed to be a turn-key solution and I don't provide support for it.
